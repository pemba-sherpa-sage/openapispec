      Default unit of measure for Inventory, Order Entry, and Purchasing transactions. This is the default unit within a unit of measure group for transactions that contain items associated with the group.
      For example, Count is a standard unit of measure group with Each, Pair, and Dozen defined as related units. The Each unit can be set to be the default unit for inventory transactions.
