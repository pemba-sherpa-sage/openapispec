      A tax schedule identifies the tax details that are applied when the schedule is referenced by a tax schedule map. 
      For example, a tax schedule named "Purchase Goods Standard Rate" could include one tax detail named "Purchase Goods Standard Rate". When this schedule is referenced, the tax detail is applied. See [Tax schedules&mdash;Taxes application](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Taxes/Indirect_Tax/VAT_and_GST/Setup/Tax_objects/tax-schedules.htm) for more information.
