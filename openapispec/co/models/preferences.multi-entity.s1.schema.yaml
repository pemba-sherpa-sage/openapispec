    properties:
      enableForJournalEntry:
        type: boolean
        description: |
          Set to `true` to have Intacct automatically create offsetting entries for journal entries that involve two or more entities. Set to `false` to require all balancing line items to be entered manually.

          Note: This option is incompatible with the __Enable journal entry auto-balancing__ option on the Configuration page for General Ledger, which automatically balances GL journal entries using the specified GL auto-balancing account.

        type: boolean
        description: |
          Set to `true` to disable automatic tracking of inter-entity payables and receivables for  transactions. For example, although one entity can still pay a bill on behalf of another entity, Intacct will not track the inter-entity payables and receivables by creating offsetting journal entries in the affected entities.

          Setting this to `true` disables inter-entity transactions, and you do not need to specify a `creditsJournal`.

          Set to `true` to turn off the automatic recording of inter-entity payables and receivables for credits, adjustments, and advances. Intacct won't automatically track the inter-entity payables and receivables by creating offsetting journal entries in the affected entities. 
          
          You do not need to specify a `creditsJournal` when this field is enabled.
