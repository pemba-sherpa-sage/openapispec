      Use billing price lists to create pricing strategies for items with prices
      that are determined based on a fixed fee, the quantity used, or the
      contracted quantity. Billing price lists support several pricing models,
      including prices per thousands, discount tiers, minimum flat fees, and
      more. A company can have multiple billing price lists. 


      The `billing-price-list` object is a header for billing price list
      entries. You create the list and then create the billing price list
      entries associated with the list.

        Deletes a contract. You can delete a contract if there are no related
        records. For example, you can delete a contract if there are no contract
        lines, no expense lines, no signed-off compliance tasks, no notes, and
        so on. If there are related records, delete each record and then delete
        the contract.


        If you cannot delete a related record, cancel the contract instead.

        Deletes an MEA price list. You can delete a MEA price list if it has not
        been used by any contracts. Deleted price lists cannot be recovered.
        Alternatively, you can change the status to Inactive, which prevents it
        from being used but retains the price list for historical purposes.
