For example, you can delete a contract if there are no contract lines, no expense lines, no signed-off compliance tasks, no notes, and so on. If there are related records, delete each record and then delete the contract.

        If you cannot delete a related record, cancel the contract instead.

Each project/item combination on each Project time contract line within a contract must be unique.
            * `projectAndTask`: All hours billed from timesheets associated with a particular task and with a particular project will be combined and used to determine the actual revenue for the contract line. Each project/task combination on each Project time contract line within a contract must be unique.

             Only applicable if `termType` = `termed` and "Enable deferred revenue for Time & Materials projects" is turned on for the company.
