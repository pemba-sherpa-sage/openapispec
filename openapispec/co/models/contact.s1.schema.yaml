  You can think of contacts as a common, shared address book that's used across a company by many people for a variety of purposes. Contacts hold all the information needed to contact an individual or business, including name, email address, phone number, mailing address, and more. 
  
  Contacts are almost always used with other Sage Intacct objects, such as vendors, customers, or locations. For example, you specify a contact in Order Entry and Purchasing transactions to set a ship-to, bill-to, pay-to, or return-to addresses, and to determine tax on transactions.
