      Group membership type. The group type and options that you select determine which locations will be included in report data when you filter on this location group.

      If you are creating financial reports that show locations in rows or columns, your selection will also determine the column headings and row headings that will appear, and the order in which they will be listed.

      * `specific` - Specify the locations to include and their order in the `members` array.
      * `all` - All locations that match the `memberFilter` criteria.
